# Gemini Python Experiments

This directory serves as a sandbox for experimenting with Python scripts generated by Gemini Code Assist. It contains various small utility scripts and examples created to test code generation capabilities.

## Current Scripts

*   `sort_and_print.py`: A script that generates a list of 10 items, sorts them alphabetically, and prints the last 3 items in uppercase.

## Maintenance

This file should be updated as new scripts are added to the directory.
