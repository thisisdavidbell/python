# Gemini Python Experiments

This directory serves as a sandbox for experimenting with Python scripts generated by Gemini Code Assist. It contains various small utility scripts and examples created to test code generation capabilities.

## Current Scripts

*   `sort_and_print.py`: A script that generates a list of 10 items, sorts them alphabetically, and prints the last 3 items in uppercase.
*   `user_sort.py`: A script that prompts the user for 10 items, sorts them, and prints the last 3 items using a reusable function.

## Maintenance

This file should be updated as new scripts are added to the directory.

## Project Evolution (Prompt History)

The content of this directory was generated through the following sequence of user requests:

1.  Create the `python/gemini` directory and a script (`sort_and_print.py`) to sort a list of 10 items and print the last 3 in uppercase.
2.  Create a README describing the directory's purpose.
3.  Update the README with more details and a list of scripts.
4.  Fix bugs in `sort_and_print.py` related to list slicing syntax and logic.
5.  Create a new script (`user_sort.py`) for user input and refactor `sort_and_print.py` to provide a reusable sorting function.
6.  Commit the changes to version control.
